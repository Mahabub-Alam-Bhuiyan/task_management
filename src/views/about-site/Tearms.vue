    <h3>TaskManagement User Terms of Service</h3>
    <small>
      <b>Effective Date: December 1, 2021</b></small>
    <p>
      TaskManagement, Inc. (“TaskManagement,” “we,” “our”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application (collectively, the “Service”), and websites, including but not limited to www.TaskManagement.com, wavelength.com, blog.TaskManagement.com, community.TaskManagement.com (the “Websites”). TaskManagement, Inc. is located at 633 Folsom Street Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94107-3600. If you have any questions about these User Terms of Service (the “Terms”), please email us at terms-questions@TaskManagement.com. TaskManagement has three different types of users depending on the TaskManagement products used:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> We call users of the Websites “Site Visitors.” </li>
      <li> We call users who use the free version of the TaskManagement Service “Free Users.” While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers.
      </li>
      <li>  We call users who use the Service as part of a paid TaskManagement subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) “Subscribers.” The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between TaskManagement and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the “Customer Agreement”).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We refer to these three types of users collectively as “Users” or “you” for purposes of these Terms. Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal agreement directly between you and TaskManagement and explain the rules governing use of the Service and Websites. By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service and Websites. We may, from time to time, modify these Terms. Please check this page periodically for updates. We will comply with applicable local legal obligations to provide you with notice of changes to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
    </p>
    <h5><b>1.</b> ELIGIBILITY AND SCOPE</h5>
    <p><b>1.1</b> General. To use the Service and Websites you must be, and represent and warrant that you are, at least 13 years of age and competent to agree to these Terms.
